## Description

Unity Pathfinders Visualized is an interactive Unity project that allows you to explore and understand various pathfinding algorithms visually. This project leverages the power of Unity's Gizmos to provide real-time visualization of pathfinding algorithms within the Unity editor.

### Pathfinding Algorithms

The heart of this project lies in its implementation of three distinct pathfinding algorithms:

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-First Search is a classic pathfinding algorithm known for its simplicity and effectiveness in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. In Unity Pathfinders Visualized, BFS is brought to life through code that meticulously explores the grid, making it ideal for scenarios where finding the quickest route is essential.

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search, another well-known algorithm, is characterized by its ability to explore as deeply as possible along a single branch before backtracking. Within this project, the DFS algorithm is implemented with precision, offering insights into its behavior and applications such as maze generation and topological sorting.

#### Swarm Pathfinding

Swarm Pathfinding is a unique and innovative algorithm that draws inspiration from swarm behavior. It provides an intriguing alternative to traditional pathfinding techniques. In this project, you'll find a carefully crafted implementation of Swarm Pathfinding, allowing you to witness how a simulated swarm navigates obstacles to reach its destination.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Unity Pathfinders Visualized excels in providing real-time visual feedback of pathfinding algorithms as they operate in the Unity editor. Observe how each algorithm explores the grid, making decisions that lead to optimal paths.

- **Dynamic Obstacle Generation**: With every run of the scene, the project generates a dynamic grid filled with unique obstacles. These obstacles can be adjusted and randomized, offering endless possibilities for testing the algorithms in various challenging scenarios.

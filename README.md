## Overview
Unity Pathfinders Visualized is a Unity project designed to help you understand and visualize various pathfinding algorithms using Gizmos from the Unity engine. This project provides an interactive environment for learning and experimenting with pathfinding techniques within the Unity editor.

## Supported Algorithms
This project currently includes the following pathfinding algorithms:

### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
Breadth-First Search is an algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadthward motion. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### Depth-First Search (DFS)
Depth-First Search is an algorithm that explores as far as possible along a branch before backtracking. It is commonly used for tasks such as topological sorting and maze generation.

### Swarm Pathfinding
Swarm Pathfinding is a unique pathfinding algorithm inspired by swarm behavior. It offers an alternative approach to solving pathfinding problems by simulating the collective behavior of swarms.

## Description
The code in this repository serves as the foundation for Unity Pathfinders Visualized. It includes several key components and functions to achieve the following:

- **Grid Generation:** The code generates a grid-based environment within the Unity scene. This grid serves as the canvas on which the pathfinding algorithms operate.

- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** The repository contains implementations of three pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Swarm Pathfinding. These algorithms are designed to find the optimal path from a start point to an end point within the grid.

- **Real-Time Visualization:** Utilizing Unity Gizmos, the code provides real-time visualization of the pathfinding algorithms within the Unity editor. This visualization helps users understand how each algorithm explores the grid and makes decisions.

- **Dynamic Obstacle Generation:** With each run of the scene, the code generates a dynamic grid with unique obstacles. These obstacles can be adjusted and randomized, allowing users to test the algorithms in various challenging environments.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Visualization:** Utilizing Unity Gizmos, this project provides real-time visualization of pathfinding algorithms within the Unity editor. You can observe the algorithms in action and gain insights into their inner workings.

- **Dynamic Obstacle Generation:** Each time you run the scene, the project generates a dynamic grid with unique obstacles. This feature allows you to test the algorithms in diverse and challenging environments.

## Description

Unity Pathfinders Visualized is a Unity project that demonstrates pathfinding algorithms in action. This project provides implementations of three fundamental pathfinding algorithms:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** DFS explores deeply along a single path before backtracking, useful for tasks like maze generation.

- **Swarm Pathfinding:** Inspired by swarm behavior, this unique algorithm offers an alternative approach to pathfinding.

## Features

- **Algorithm Simulations:** Observe how BFS, DFS, and Swarm Pathfinding algorithms navigate grids.

- **Dynamic Grids:** The project generates dynamic grids with randomly placed obstacles for varied testing scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with Unity Pathfinders Visualized:

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Open the project in Unity.

3. Run the scene to interact with the pathfinding algorithms.

4. Activate Gizmos in the Unity editor for improved visualization.

**Please Note:** This project cannot be built as it relies on Unity Gizmos, which is an editor-only feature. It is intended for use within the Unity editor for algorithm visualization.

## Usage

Customize pathfinding experiments by adjusting parameters and selecting different algorithms. Explore algorithm behavior in various grid environments.

# Unity Pathfinders Visualized

![BFS Example](https://github.com/Silent0Wings/Unity-Pathfinders-Visualized/blob/main/ScreenShot/BFS%20(6).png)

## Description
**Unity Pathfinders Visualized** is a Unity project demonstrating key pathfinding algorithms. The project currently implements:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Efficient in finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Bidirectional Breadth-First Search:** Enhances BFS by searching from both the start and end points simultaneously.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Useful for tasks like maze generation, exploring deeply along a single path before backtracking.

## Features
- **Algorithm Simulations:** Visualize BFS, Bidirectional BFS, and DFS algorithms in action.
- **Dynamic Grids:** Test these algorithms on various grid layouts and obstacles.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open in Unity.
3. Run the scene to observe the pathfinding simulations.
4. Enable Gizmos in Unity for better visualization.

*Note: This project is intended for Unity editor use only.*

## Usage
- Customize experiments by tweaking parameters.
- Conduct comparative studies by selecting different algorithms.

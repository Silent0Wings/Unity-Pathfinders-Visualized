## Description
This repository is a pathfinding algorithm visualizer using Gizmos from the Unity engine. It currently includes implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Swarm Pathfinding algorithms.

## Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Visual implementations of BFS, DFS, and Swarm Pathfinding.
- **Unity Gizmos Visualization:** Real-time observation of the pathfinding algorithms within the Unity editor.
- **Random Obstacle Generation:** Each run generates a dynamic grid with unique obstacles.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Unity (specify the required version)

### Installation
1. Open the project in Unity.
2. Run the scene to see the pathfinding algorithms visualized.
3. Activate Gizmos in the Unity editor for optimal visualization.

## Usage
- The grid and obstacles are randomly generated upon each run of the scene.
- Parameters can be adjusted within the Unity Editor to observe different behaviors of BFS, DFS, and Swarm Pathfinding algorithms.

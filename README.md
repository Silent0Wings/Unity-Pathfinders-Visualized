## Description
Unity Pathfinders Visualized is a Unity project demonstrating key pathfinding algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Swarm Pathfinding. This educational tool offers insight into each algorithm's approach within a dynamic grid environment.

## Features
- **Algorithm Simulations:** Visualize BFS, DFS, and Swarm algorithms.
- **Dynamic Grids:** Test algorithms with various grid layouts and obstacles.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open in Unity.
3. Run the scene to view the pathfinding simulations.
4. Enable Gizmos in Unity for better visualization.
*Note: Project for Unity editor use only.*

## Usage
- Customize experiments by tweaking parameters.
- Select different algorithms for comparative studies.

## Visuals
![BFS Example](link-to-image)
*Add images or GIFs demonstrating the algorithms in action.*

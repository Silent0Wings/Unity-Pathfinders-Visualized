## Description
Unity Pathfinders Visualized is a Unity project that demonstrates pathfinding algorithms in action. This project provides implementations of three fundamental pathfinding algorithms:

Breadth-First Search (BFS): This algorithm efficiently finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

Depth-First Search (DFS): DFS explores deeply along a single path before backtracking, useful for tasks like maze generation.

Swarm Pathfinding: Inspired by swarm behavior, this unique algorithm offers an alternative approach to pathfinding.

## Features
- **Algorithm Simulations:** Visualize BFS, DFS, and Swarm algorithms.
- **Dynamic Grids:** Test algorithms with various grid layouts and obstacles.

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open in Unity.
3. Run the scene to view the pathfinding simulations.
4. Enable Gizmos in Unity for better visualization.
*Note: Project for Unity editor use only.*

## Usage
- Customize experiments by tweaking parameters.
- Select different algorithms for comparative studies.

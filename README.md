## Description
Unity Pathfinders Visualized is a project focused on demonstrating popular pathfinding algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) in Unity. It serves as an educational tool to visually understand how these algorithms work in navigating through spaces. The project uniquely uses Unity Gizmos for visualization, making it ideal for learning and teaching pathfinding within the Unity editor. Please note that this project is designed solely for educational purposes within the Unity editor and cannot be built into a standalone application, as it relies on Unity Gizmos, which are not available in builds. The visualization shows the pathfinding process on a grid with randomly generated obstacles, highlighting the distinct behaviors of BFS and DFS.

## Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Visual implementations of Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search.
- **Unity Gizmos Visualization:** Real-time observation of the pathfinding algorithms within the Unity editor.
- **Random Obstacle Generation:** Each run generates a dynamic grid with unique obstacles.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Unity (specify the required version)

### Installation
1. Open the project in Unity.
2. Run the scene to see the pathfinding algorithms visualized.
3. Activate Gizmos in the Unity editor for optimal visualization.

## Usage
- The grid and obstacles are randomly generated upon each run of the scene.
- Parameters can be adjusted within the Unity Editor to observe different behaviors of both BFS and DFS algorithms.

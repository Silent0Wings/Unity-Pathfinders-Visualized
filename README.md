# Unity Simple Breadth First Search
![Example Image](https://github.com/Silent0Wings/Unity-Simple-BFS/blob/main/ScreenShot/BFS%20(0).png)

## Description
This repository contains a simple and straightforward implementation of the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in Unity. Designed for educational purposes, it features an unoptimized BFS algorithm visualized using Unity Gizmos, serving as a visualization tool for understanding the BFS algorithm. Please note that this project is intended for use in the Unity editor only, as it utilizes Gizmos, which cannot be used in a build. The project demonstrates the pathfinding process on a grid with randomly generated obstacles.

## Features
- **Breadth-First Search Algorithm:** A basic implementation of BFS.
- **Unity Gizmos Visualization:** Watch the BFS algorithm in action within the Unity editor.
- **Random Obstacle Generation:** Dynamic grid environment with obstacles.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Unity

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Run the scene to see the BFS algorithm in action.
4. Activate Gizmos.

## Usage
- The grid and obstacles are generated randomly each time the scene is run.
- Use the Unity Editor to modify parameters and observe different behaviors of the BFS algorithm.
